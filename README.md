# Apple-EFI-Extracts-for-Newer-Systems
Extracts of newer Apple EFI payloads from 2018 onwards. Folders are categorized into system identifiers, followed by apple code number, folled by EFI typed. EFI type labels were categoriezed into Intel and MEFI. Intel refers to images that were standard Intel EFI images similar to systems from 2017 and earlier, and MEFI refers to a newer format used by Apple during 2018. Intersting, after 2018, 2019 systems such as the MacBookPro15,4 and 16,1 revert back to intel based images.

__Region Files:__

Region files were extracted using UEFITool and may require trimming. So don't just go flashing them without making sure they are edited (if needed).
